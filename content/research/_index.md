Subjects I am exploring through independent research. 
{{< /lead >}}

This section contains a brief list of research directions that I have explored in my own [time]({{< ref "about" >}}). At the time of writing, it is a bit out of date. My most up to date research interestes are being pursued over at [AION](https://www.aion.bio/). If you read something that sparks an idea, warrants feedback or something inbetween, [write me an email](mailto:me@benjaminbanderson.com).

Peer reviwed research can be found [here](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6213-1872). 

Here's my learning [syllabus]({{< ref "syllabus" >}}).
